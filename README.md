## Progress! (But some issues...)

This is an iFrame of something simple from week 2...

<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MGjXs4jnvuaAevEo5psiB7E0OMIIzz0rrhHftYZw7-c/pubchart?oid=5951173&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>


My week 3 charts are working and published -- [here](https://forthwritestrategies.github.io/leaflet-map-simple) and [here](https://forthwritestrategies.github.io/highcharts-scatter-csv) -- but I can't figure out why the iFrames aren't working.


This is the Leaflet Map

This is the Highcharts chart

## This is my test page for data visualization class!

I'm leaving the original instructions here...just in case.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ForthwriteStrategies/dataviz/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ForthwriteStrategies/dataviz/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
